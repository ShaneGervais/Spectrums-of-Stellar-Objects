# Spectrums-of-Stellar-Objects
This class is to calculate and analyze the Planck spectrum of stellar objects, as well by creating a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.
Some luminosities and radius' were calculated with Stefan-Boltzmann law.

The following stars are used:

- Bernard's star
- Sirius A
- Sirius B
- Arcturus
- Aldebaran
- Bellatrix

More objects can be created and we could potentially create a database for these objects.

The following class was used to help set the color of the objects in the Planck spectrum and HR diagram organized by temperature.

This was inspired by a problem by Numerical Python in Astronomy and Astrophysics by Wolfram Schmidt and Marcel Volschow.
